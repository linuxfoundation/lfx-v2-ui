# Frontend Architecture

## 🎨 Overview

The LFX One frontend is built with Angular 19 using experimental zoneless change detection, Angular Signals for state management, and a comprehensive design system based on PrimeNG and Tailwind CSS.

## 🏗 Architecture Components

### Core Framework

- **Angular 19** with experimental zoneless change detection
- **Angular Signals** for reactive state management (preferred over RxJS)
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with AngularNodeAppEngine
- **Standalone Components** with explicit imports

### UI System

- **PrimeNG 19** with custom LFX UI Core preset
- **Tailwind CSS v3** with PrimeUI plugin integration
- **CSS Layers** architecture for optimal style cascade
- **LFX Tools** web component for platform navigation

### State Management

- **Angular Signals** for component and service state
- **Service-based patterns** with computed signals
- **Reactive data flow** without Zone.js dependency
