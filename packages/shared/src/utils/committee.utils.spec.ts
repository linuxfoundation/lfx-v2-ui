// Unit tests for the committee member permission resolver (LFXV2-2059).
//
// NOTE: this repo has no unit-test runner wired yet (`ng test` has no target; testing is
// Playwright E2E only). These specs are written against the pure resolver so they execute as-is
// once a runner (e.g. Vitest via `@angular/build:unit-test`) is added — that wiring is a tracked
// follow-up. They use the Vitest/Jest-compatible `describe`/`it`/`expect` globals.
