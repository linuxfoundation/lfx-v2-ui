## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Linux Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
4. Make your changes
5. Push your changes to your fork
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

Please refer to the [README.md](README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## License Headers

**IMPORTANT**: All source code files must include the appropriate license header. This is enforced by our CI/CD pipeline.

### Required Format

The license header must appear in the first 4 lines of every source file and must contain the exact text:

```text
Copyright The Linux Foundation and each contributor to LFX.
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

### File Type Examples

#### TypeScript/JavaScript Files (.ts, .js)

```typescript
// Copyright The Linux Foundation and each contributor to LFX.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// Your code here...
```

#### HTML Files (.html)

```html
<!-- Copyright The Linux Foundation and each contributor to LFX. -->
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT -->

<!-- Your HTML here... -->
```

#### CSS/SCSS Files (.css, .scss)

```css
/* Copyright The Linux Foundation and each contributor to LFX. */
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT */

/* Your styles here... */
```

#### YAML Files (.yml, .yaml)

```yaml
# Copyright The Linux Foundation and each contributor to LFX.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

# Your YAML content here...
```

#### Shell Scripts (.sh)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Copyright The Linux Foundation and each contributor to LFX.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

# Your script here...
```

### Checking License Headers

Before committing, run the license header check:

```bash
./check-headers.sh
```

This script will identify any files missing the required license header. The script automatically excludes:

- `node_modules/`
- `.angular/`
- `dist/`
- Other generated/cached files

### Automated Checks

- **Pre-commit Hook**: The license header check runs automatically before each commit
- **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions will verify all files have proper headers on every pull request

## Code Style

### General Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Angular style guide for Angular components
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Linting

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run linting before committing:

```bash
# Run linting for all packages
yarn lint

# Run linting with auto-fix
yarn lint:fix

# Run formatting
yarn format
```

## Commit Messages

### Format

Follow the conventional commit format:

```text
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```text
feat(auth): add Auth0 integration

Implemented Auth0 authentication using express-openid-connect
middleware with proper token refresh handling.

Closes #123
```

### Sign-off

All commits must be signed off:

```bash
git commit --signoff
```

This adds a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for any new features
2. **Add Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
3. **Pass All Checks**: Ensure all tests and linting pass
4. **License Headers**: Verify all new files have proper license headers
5. **Clear Description**: Provide a clear description of changes in the PR
6. **Link Issues**: Reference any related issues
7. **Deploy Preview**: (Optional) Deploy and preview the feature or
   change in a hosted environment

### PR Title Format

Use the same conventional commit format for PR titles:

```text
feat(component): add new table component
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Run e2e tests
yarn e2e
```

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include unit tests
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- E2E tests for critical user flows

### Deploy Preview

Contributors with write access to the repository have the option to add
the **deploy-preview** label to their pull request. Adding this label will
deploy the pull request to a hosted Kubernetes development cluster in an
isolated namespace. A link to the hosted deployment will be added as a
comment to the pull request.

When the pull request is closed or the **deploy-preview** label is
removed, the deployment will be removed.
