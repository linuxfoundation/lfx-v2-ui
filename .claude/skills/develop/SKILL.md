# LFX One Development Guide

You are helping a contributor build within the LFX One codebase. This skill handles all development work: components, services, backend endpoints, shared types, and full end-to-end features.

**Important:** You are integrating features within existing architecture — not making architectural decisions. If the work requires changes to routing, auth, middleware, or infrastructure, flag it for a code owner.

## Step 1: Understand the Work

Ask the contributor what they're building. Based on their answer, determine which workflow(s) apply:

| Workflow               | When to Use                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Types**       | New interfaces, enums, or constants needed                                |
| **Backend Endpoint**   | New API route with controller + service                                   |
| **Frontend Service**   | New Angular service or methods on an existing one                         |
| **Frontend Component** | New Angular component (page, module-specific, shared, or PrimeNG wrapper) |
| **Full Feature**       | End-to-end integration (combines multiple workflows above)                |

For a **full feature**, execute the workflows in this order: Shared Types → Backend Endpoint → Frontend Service → Frontend Component.

## Step 2: Required Reading

Read the relevant architecture docs **before generating code**. These are the source of truth.

### Always Read

- **`CLAUDE.md`** → "Component Organization Pattern" section — class structure ordering, signal patterns

### For Frontend Work

- **`docs/architecture/frontend/component-architecture.md`** — Component placement, module structure, PrimeNG wrapper strategy
- **`docs/architecture/frontend/angular-patterns.md`** — Signals, change detection, template syntax, inject() pattern
- **`docs/architecture/frontend/styling-system.md`** — CSS layers, Tailwind configuration
- **`docs/architecture/frontend/state-management.md`** — Service-based state, signal architecture
- **`docs/architecture/frontend/drawer-pattern.md`** — Drawer components with lazy loading and charts (if building a drawer)

### For Backend Work

- **`docs/architecture/backend/ssr-server.md`** — Server architecture, route registration
- **`docs/architecture/backend/logging-monitoring.md`** — Logger service usage, operation lifecycle, log levels
- **`docs/architecture/backend/error-handling-architecture.md`** — Error classification, response format
- **`docs/architecture/backend/server-helpers.md`** — Helper patterns, validation, pagination helpers
- **`docs/architecture/backend/pagination.md`** — Cursor-based pagination patterns (if endpoint returns lists)

### For Shared Package Work

- **`docs/architecture/shared/package-architecture.md`** — Package structure, exports, utilities, validators

### External Microservice Repos

When building or modifying features that involve API calls, you **must** check the relevant upstream microservice repo to understand the actual API contract (endpoints, request/response schemas, query parameters, error responses).

| Domain            | External Repo                                                                                 | Key Areas to Check                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Queries**       | [lfx-v2-query-service](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-query-service)               | Resource types, query params, pagination, filters |
| **Projects**      | [lfx-v2-project-service](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-project-service)           | Project CRUD, slugs, membership                   |
| **Meetings**      | [lfx-v2-meeting-service](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-meeting-service)           | Meeting CRUD, RSVPs, recordings, calendar         |
| **Mailing Lists** | [lfx-v2-mailing-list-service](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-mailing-list-service) | Groups.io integration, subscriptions              |
| **Committees**    | [lfx-v2-committee-service](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-committee-service)       | Committee CRUD, membership, roles                 |
| **Voting**        | [lfx-v2-voting-service](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-voting-service)             | Poll CRUD, casting votes, results                 |
| **Surveys**       | [lfx-v2-survey-service](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-survey-service)             | Survey CRUD, responses, NPS analytics             |

**How to check external repos:**

```bash
# Browse repo structure to find routes/controllers
gh api repos/linuxfoundation/<repo-name>/contents/src --jq '.[].name'

# Read a specific file for endpoint definitions
gh api repos/linuxfoundation/<repo-name>/contents/src/routes/<file>.ts \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d

# Search for endpoint patterns
gh api "search/code?q=router+repo:linuxfoundation/<repo-name>" --jq '.items[].path'
```

**What to look for:**

- **Route definitions** — Available endpoints and HTTP methods
- **Request validation** — Required fields, types, constraints
- **Response schemas** — What the API actually returns (field names, nesting, types)
- **Query parameters** — Supported filters, pagination params, sort options
- **Error responses** — Error codes and response format

> **Why this matters:** The LFX One backend is a thin orchestration layer — it proxies requests to these microservices via `MicroserviceProxyService`. The request/response shapes in this UI codebase must match what the upstream services actually accept and return. Guessing at API shapes leads to runtime failures.

## Step 3: Check What Exists

Before creating anything, check what already exists to avoid duplicates:

```bash
# Frontend
ls apps/lfx-one/src/app/modules/                    # Feature modules
ls apps/lfx-one/src/app/shared/components/           # Shared components
ls apps/lfx-one/src/app/shared/services/             # Frontend services

# Backend
ls apps/lfx-one/src/server/controllers/              # Controllers
ls apps/lfx-one/src/server/services/                 # Backend services
ls apps/lfx-one/src/server/routes/                   # Route files

# Shared package
ls packages/shared/src/interfaces/                   # Interfaces
ls packages/shared/src/enums/                        # Enums
ls packages/shared/src/constants/                    # Constants
```

If related code already exists, **read it first** and extend it rather than creating new files.

## Step 4: Read an Existing Example

Read a representative file in the target area to match the team's current patterns. Pick something in the same module or domain as the work being done.

## Step 5: Build

Follow the workflow(s) identified in Step 1. The sections below provide the key conventions for each.

---

### Shared Types

**Location:** `packages/shared/src/interfaces/`, `enums/`, or `constants/`

- License header on all new files
- Use TypeScript interfaces (not union types) for better maintainability
- File suffixes: `.interface.ts`, `.enum.ts`, `.constants.ts`
- Use `as const` for constant objects to get literal types
- Export from the barrel file (`index.ts`) in the same directory
- NEVER define interfaces locally in component or service files

---

### Backend Endpoint

Creates three files: **service** → **controller** → **route**.

#### Step 0: Check the Upstream API Contract

Before writing any backend code, **check the relevant external microservice repo** (see the External Microservice Repos table above) to understand:

1. What endpoints are available and what HTTP methods they support
2. What request body / query params the upstream API expects
3. What response shape the upstream API returns

Use `gh api` to browse the repo and read route/controller files. This ensures the proxy calls in your service match the actual upstream API.

#### Service (`src/server/services/<name>.service.ts`)

- Uses `MicroserviceProxyService` for ALL external API calls
- API reads: `/query/resources`, writes: `/itx/...`
- **Authentication: Default to the user's bearer token** (passed via `req.bearerToken` from the OIDC session) for all authenticated routes. Only use M2M tokens when the upstream service requires service credentials **and** the route has already enforced authorization using the user token (for example, privileged upstream reads that temporarily swap `req.bearerToken` to an M2M token and then restore it). For public endpoints (`/public/api/...`) with no user session, use M2M tokens. See the "Authentication: User Tokens vs M2M Tokens" section in development rules.
- `logger.debug()` for step-by-step tracing, `logger.info()` for significant operations
- `logger.warning()` for recoverable errors (returning null/empty)
- NEVER use `serverLogger` directly — always use `logger` from `./services/logger.service`

#### Controller (`src/server/controllers/<name>.controller.ts`)

- `logger.startOperation()` → `try/catch` → `logger.success()` or `next(error)`
- Pass errors to `next(error)` — NEVER use `res.status(500).json()`
- Operation names in snake_case (e.g., `get_items`, `create_item`)
- Use `validateUidParameter` from helpers for parameter validation

#### Route (`src/server/routes/<name>.route.ts`)

- Express Router with controller method bindings
- Follow the pattern from an existing route file

#### Route Registration

**IMPORTANT:** The route must be registered in `server.ts`, which is a protected file.
Tell the contributor:

> "The route file is created, but it needs to be registered in `server.ts`. Since that's a protected infrastructure file, please ask a code owner to add the route registration."

---

### Frontend Service

**Location:** `apps/lfx-one/src/app/shared/services/<name>.service.ts`

> **API contract:** If the backend endpoint doesn't exist yet, check the relevant external microservice repo (see External Microservice Repos table above) to understand the response shape. The backend proxy is a thin layer — the data structure the frontend receives closely mirrors what the upstream microservice returns.

- `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` — always tree-shakeable
- `inject(HttpClient)` — never constructor-based DI
- **GET requests:** `catchError(() => of(defaultValue))` for graceful error handling
- **POST/PUT/DELETE requests:** `take(1)` and let errors propagate to the component
- **Shared state:** Use `signal()` for data consumed by multiple components
- **Signals can't use rxjs pipes** — use `computed()` or `toSignal()` for reactive transforms
- **Interfaces:** Import from `@lfx-one/shared/interfaces`, never define locally
- **API paths:** Use relative paths (e.g., `/api/items`) — the proxy handles routing

---

### Frontend Component

#### Placement

Determine the component category and place it accordingly:

| Category                        | Location                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Route/page component            | `modules/<module>/<component-name>/`            |
| Module-specific component       | `modules/<module>/components/<component-name>/` |
| Shared component (cross-module) | `shared/components/<component-name>/`           |
| PrimeNG wrapper component       | `shared/components/<component-name>/`           |

Check `docs/architecture/frontend/component-architecture.md` for detailed placement guidelines.

A new module can be created if the feature represents a distinct domain, but prefer existing modules when the feature fits.

#### Files

Generate three files (`.component.ts`, `.component.html`, `.component.scss`), each with the license header.

#### Class Structure (from CLAUDE.md)

1. Private injections (`inject()`, `readonly`)
2. Public fields from inputs/dialog data
3. Forms
4. Model signals (`model()`)
5. WritableSignals (`signal()`)
6. Computed/toSignal signals (via private init functions)
7. Constructor
8. Public methods
9. Protected methods
10. Private initializer functions
11. Private helper methods

#### Key Rules

- Standalone components with direct imports (no barrel exports)
- Signals: `signal()`, `input()`, `output()`, `computed()`, `model()` — never constructor DI
- Templates: `@if`/`@for` syntax, `data-testid` attributes, `flex + flex-col + gap-*` (never `space-y-*`)
- Do not nest ternary expressions
- For PrimeNG wrappers, follow the wrapper strategy in the component architecture doc

## Step 6: Validate

Run the full validation suite:

```bash
yarn lint          # Check for linting errors
yarn format        # Apply formatting
yarn build         # Verify build succeeds
```

Fix any issues before finishing.

## Step 7: Summary

Provide a clear summary:

- All files created or modified
- Any new shared types and their import paths
- Any actions needed from code owners (route registration, routing changes, etc.)
- How to use the new code (inject services, import components, etc.)
- Remind them to run `/preflight` before submitting a PR
