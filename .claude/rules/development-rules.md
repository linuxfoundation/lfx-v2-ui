# Development Rules

## Shared Package

- All shared types, interfaces, and constants are centralized in `@lfx-one/shared` package
- Use TypeScript interfaces instead of union types for better maintainability
- Shared package uses direct source imports during development for hot reloading
- All interfaces, reusable constants, and enums should live in the shared package

## AI Service

- **AI Service Integration**: Claude Sonnet 4 model via LiteLLM proxy for meeting agenda generation
- **AI Environment Variables**: `AI_PROXY_URL` and `AI_API_KEY` required for AI functionality
- **M2M Environment Variables**: `M2M_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `M2M_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` for machine-to-machine auth

## Authentication: User Tokens vs M2M Tokens

**Default: Prefer user bearer tokens.** The vast majority of endpoints must use the authenticated user's bearer token (`req.bearerToken` from the OIDC session). This is the normal auth flow — do NOT reach for M2M tokens unless you are in a public endpoint context or performing an explicit privileged upstream call that cannot be made with a user token.

**M2M tokens represent the application, not a user.** They should be used only for:

- **Public-facing endpoints where no user session exists** (e.g. public meeting pages or public meeting registration)
- **Explicit privileged upstream calls** from an authenticated route, _after_ the route has validated the user's access/authorization in-app, and only for the specific upstream request that requires application-level credentials (e.g. certain meeting registrant or invitation checks)

In the authenticated-route case, always:

- Keep enforcing user-level authorization and checks in-app
- Limit the M2M token usage to the minimal upstream call scope
- Restore the original user bearer token / auth context immediately after the privileged call

**Do NOT use M2M tokens when:**

- Replacing the user's identity or permissions for normal in-app operations
- Building a new protected API endpoint (`/api/...`) where user identity and permissions should drive behavior
- Skipping or weakening per-user authorization checks because "the service has M2M access"
- Attributing user actions in a way that cannot be tied back to the initiating user in audit logs

**Why this matters:** M2M tokens lose all user identity, permissions, and audit trail. Misusing them (for example, instead of user tokens for normal authenticated flows, or without restoring the original token context) means the backend cannot reliably enforce per-user authorization, and audit logs cannot attribute actions to the correct user.

## External Microservice Repos

When building or modifying API integrations, always check the upstream microservice repo to verify the actual API contract before writing proxy calls or defining interfaces:

| Domain        | Repo                                                                                          |

- Use `gh api repos/linuxfoundation/<repo>/contents/<path>` to browse and read files
- Check route definitions, request validation, response schemas, and query parameters
- The LFX One backend is a thin proxy layer — request/response shapes must match upstream

## Code Quality

- **License headers are required on all source files** — run `./check-headers.sh` to verify
- **Pre-commit hooks enforce license headers** — commits will fail without proper headers
- Always run `yarn format` from the root of the project to ensure formatting is done after all changes
- Always run `yarn lint` before `yarn build` to validate linting
- Always run `yarn build` to validate that changes compile correctly
- Do not nest ternary expressions
- Always use `flex + flex-col + gap-*` instead of `space-y-*`
- Always prepend "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)" if you assisted with the code
- Always use sequential thinking MCP for planning before making changes

## Testing

- **E2E tests use dual architecture** — both content-based (`*.spec.ts`) and structural (`*-robust.spec.ts`) tests
- **Always add `data-testid` attributes** when creating new components for reliable test targeting
- **Run `yarn e2e` before major changes** to ensure all tests pass consistently
- **Use `data-testid` naming convention** — `[section]-[component]-[element]` for hierarchical structure
- **Test responsive behavior** — validate mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports appropriately
- When running tests to validate UI tests, use `reporter=list`

## Documentation Maintenance

When editing files in `docs/`:

- **Keep all explanations** — code examples, pattern demonstrations, config snippets, checklists, implementation steps, and cross-references are explanations, not clutter
- **Remove exhaustive per-item listings** — if the same pattern is repeated for every instance (e.g., listing every wrapper component's API individually), keep one representative example and summarize the rest
- **Remove true duplicates** — if the same code block or configuration appears twice in a file, keep the more detailed version
- **Replace stale status trackers** — "Implemented / Not Implemented" checklists go stale; replace with a concise summary of what's implemented
- **Remove aspirational schedules** — "Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly" maintenance schedules that aren't enforced by code don't belong in architecture docs
- **Remove stale version footers** — "Last Updated" dates go stale silently
- **Keep related documentation and external resource links** — cross-references help readers navigate the docs
- **Keep examples** — real-world examples are explanations, even if they demonstrate similar patterns; they show different use cases
- **Keep ops debugging commands only if architecture-relevant** — kubectl/snowsql commands belong in runbooks, not architecture docs
- **Remove specific benchmark numbers** — values like "Current: ~1.5MB ✅" go stale and are hard to maintain

## JIRA

- The JIRA project key for this is `LFXV2`. All tickets associated to this repo should generally be in there.
- JIRA sprint field is `customfield_10020`. When creating tickets, assign to the current user and current sprint.
